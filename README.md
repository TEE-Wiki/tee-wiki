# TEE Wiki

The TEE Wiki is a collaborative knowledge base focused on Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) and their role in decentralized systems, with particular emphasis on applications in Web3. Its primary goals are to:
- Provide accurate, up-to-date documentation on the principles, components, and implementation details of TEEs.
- Educate developers, researchers, and ecosystem participants about TEE capabilities such as remote attestation, confidential compute, and enclave-based architectures.
- Curate relevant examples, projects, and references that demonstrate the practical use of TEEs in privacy-preserving and verifiable systems.
This repository is intended to serve as a shared technical resource to help standardize understanding and accelerate responsible adoption of TEE technology.

### Contributing to the wiki
Contributions are welcome from developers, researchers, and technical writers. You can help by:
- Adding or updating explanations for core TEE concepts (e.g., attestation flows, TCB composition, enclave isolation).
- Documenting real-world projects or protocols that utilize TEEs.
- Improving content clarity, structure, or formatting.
- Contributing visual aids (e.g., architecture diagrams, flowcharts).
- Reviewing or refining existing content for technical accuracy.
To contribute:
1. Fork this repository and create a feature branch.
2. Make your changes with clear commit messages.
3. Submit a pull request describing the intent and scope of your contribution.
4. An administrator will review the submission and provide feedback or merge your request.

All contributions should prioritize clarity, accuracy, and technical rigor. Where possible, cite reputable sources or specifications to support claims.
