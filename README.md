# TEE Wiki

This is a public resource for learning about Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). Our aim is to provide comprehensive coverage of key concepts, research advancements, and real-world applications of TEEs.

Whether you're a researcher or developer, this wiki is designed to help you better understand the security guarantees and technical challenges behind TEEs.

We invite everyone interested in TEEs to contribute, improve, and expand this resource by submitting a pull request.

Together, let's build a trusted and verifiable ecosystem.
