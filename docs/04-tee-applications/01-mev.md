# MEV

Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) refers to the maximum value that can be extracted from block production by including, excluding, and changing the order of transactions. This can harm the end user, for example via sandwich attacks or frontrunning, which results in a significantly worse execution price and undermines fairness.

TEEs can help mitigate many of the negative externalities of MEV, notable examples from [Flashbots](https://www.flashbots.net/) include:
* [BuilderNet](https://buildernet.org/): A decentralized block building network designed to neutralize exclusive orderflow deals, enhance Ethereum’s censorship resistance, and accelerate decentralization across rollups and apps.
* [Rollup-Boost](https://writings.flashbots.net/introducing-rollup-boost): A platform for rollup extensions like verifiable block building, fast confirmation times, strong user guarantees, and MEV internalization
* [SUAVE](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth): Decentralizes the MEV supply chain by enabling centralized infrastructure (builders, relays, centralized RFQ routing, etc.) to be programmed as smart contracts on a decentralized blockchain.
