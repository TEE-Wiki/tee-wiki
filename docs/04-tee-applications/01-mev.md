# MEV

Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) refers to profit captured by reordering or injecting transactions within a block. This is often via sandwich or frontrunning attacks that drain user funds and undermine fairness.

TEEs counter MEV by enabling encrypted block building, which hides transaction contents until after a validator commits. Project like Flashbotsâ€™ TEE-powered builders and protocols like [SUAVE](https://github.com/flashbots/suave-geth) let you set private execution rules inside the enclave, so your transaction goes exactly where and when you want it, without leaking to the public mempool.
