# MPC Nodes 

MPC (Multi-Party Computation) Nodes are specialized computing nodes that participate in distributed cryptographic protocols where multiple parties jointly compute a function while keeping their individual inputs private. These nodes are essential for applications requiring secure computation across multiple participants without revealing sensitive data to each other.

## Why TEEs are Beneficial for MPC Nodes

MPC Nodes handle highly sensitive cryptographic operations and often manage private keys that must remain secure even from the node operators themselves. Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) provide critical security advantages for MPC Node deployments:

### Enhanced Key Protection

MPC Nodes require access to cryptographic keys for participating in secure computation protocols. In traditional setups, these keys must be accessible to the node operators, creating a significant security vulnerability. TEEs solve this problem by allowing keys to be generated and stored within the secure enclave, where they are never exposed to the host system or its operators.

The keys can be used for cryptographic operations within the TEE, but their actual values remain completely hidden from anyone outside the enclave, including the node operators themselves. This ensures that even if the infrastructure is compromised, the cryptographic keys remain protected.

### Elimination of Collision Risk

A critical security concern with MPC Nodes is the risk of key collisionâ€”where malicious operators could potentially access, copy, or misuse the private keys to impersonate the node or compromise the entire MPC protocol. TEEs eliminate this risk by ensuring that keys are never accessible to the host system.

Since the keys are generated and stored exclusively within the TEE, there is no possibility for operators to extract, copy, or misuse them. This prevents collision attacks where an adversary could gain unauthorized access to the MPC protocol by compromising the node's cryptographic material.

The combination of enhanced key protection and collision prevention makes TEEs essential for secure MPC Node deployments, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of multi-party computation protocols.
