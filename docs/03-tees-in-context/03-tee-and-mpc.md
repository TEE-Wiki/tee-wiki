# TEE + MPC

MPC is vulnerable to collusion between trusted parties. While having more trusted parties with a higher threshold is a possible solution, the complexity of coordination increases with the number of participants.

Alternatively, multiple trusted parties can compute within individual TEEs to guarantee the execution integrity of the computation.
