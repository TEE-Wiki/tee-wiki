# Types of TEEs

| Type                          | Examples                                                  | Mechanism                                                                                                | Advantages                                                                          | Disadvantages                                                                                 | Notes                                                                                             |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Process-Based Isolation       | Intel SGX                                                 | Isolated memory region within a single process (enclave); system call boundaries enforce separation        | Small TCB; simple attestation; clear separation of trusted/untrusted logic          | Hard to develop; needs code rewrites; poor support for legacy apps                            | First widely-used commercial TEE; foundational model for enclave-based security                   |
| VM-Based Isolation            | Intel TDX, AMD SEV, ARM CCA                               | Entire VM runs in a hardware-isolated environment with memory encryption and extended TCB                | Full OS access; high compatibility with existing apps; easy for developers          | Large TCB; complex attestation; potential need for runtime monitoring                         | Emerging as the preferred model for cloud-native TEEs; trades security for dev ease             |
| Hypervisor-Based Isolation    | AWS Nitro Enclave                                         | Uses a hypervisor and HSM to partition a VM into trusted/untrusted regions with limited hardware backing | Fast deployment on general-purpose machines; moderate development effort            | Relies on EC2 host instance encryption; limited device support; weaker isolation assumptions  | A transitional model between legacy and full VM-based TEEs; good for cloud services             |
| Design Your Own TEE           | ARM TrustZone, BYOTEE (Software + Hardware Co-design)     | Developers build TEEs using hardware toolkits, implementing their own OS, attestation, and trust logic   | Full control over TEE architecture; supports trusted I/O paths (e.g., camera, keyboard) | Extremely complex to implement; requires custom OS, provisioning, and attestation design      | Best suited for embedded/mobile systems or privacy-critical interfaces                            |
| Software + Physical Isolation | SpaceTEE/SpaceCoin, Microsoft Project Natick (Hypothetical) | No hardware isolation; physical inaccessibility enforced, combined with software-only control and trust  | Works on any hardware; physically tamper-resistant by isolation; zero cryptographic hardware requirements | Relies entirely on no physical access; unverifiable; not suited for hostile environments    | Conceptual TEE model; good for compliance-driven or closed-system deployment                    |
