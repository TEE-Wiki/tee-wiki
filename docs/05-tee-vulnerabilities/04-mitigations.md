## Proof of Cloud

A defence-in-depth framework to verify the integrity of physical infrastructure that hosts the TEE.
Proof of Cloud utilizes 3 levels of verification (Human-Assisted, Automated, and Continuous Monitoring) to prove that workloads only execute in legitimate data centers with no unauthorized physical access.

A public registry of cloud-hosted server hardware identities allows anyone to verify that any hardware is included in the registry.
