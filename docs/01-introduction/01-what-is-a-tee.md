# What is a TEE?

A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a secure area within a main processor that ensures code and data loaded inside are protected with confidentiality and integrity guarantees. 

TEEs play a crucial role in maintaining security by isolating sensitive operations from the rest of the system in a secure enclave. This makes it possible to protect data-in-use, securing it from malicious actors even if they gain access to the host system. 

See [Types of TEEs](/docs/02-tee-types/01-overview) for an overview of the different types of TEEs available today.
