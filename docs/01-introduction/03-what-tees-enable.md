# What TEEs enable

TEEs open new possibilities for secure computation in various fields, especially when handling confidential data and when trust in computational integrity is essential.

- **Authenticated data feeds for blockchains (oracles, TLS streams)**: TEEs enable secure data feeds (oracles) for blockchains, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of data like price feeds or other real-world data. This authenticated data can then be used in smart contracts, improving the reliability and security of decentralized applications.  

- **Open and efficient order flow that preserves trade privacy**: TEEs allow financial institutions to preserve the privacy of order flows and market operations, ensuring that sensitive data about transactions remains confidential before and after execution. This reduces front-running risks, which are common in high-frequency trading. 

- **Confidential machine learning and AI**: TEEs enable secure and privacy-preserving machine learning by allowing models to be trained on sensitive data within the enclave, keeping it confidential throughout the process. This allows companies to train AI models collaboratively without exposing proprietary data.
